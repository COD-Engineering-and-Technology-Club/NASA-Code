Please note that the RPi3's internal  WiFi antenna is NOT currently operational. 
Two blacklist comments were added to the file located at:
/etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf 
These two comments (blacklist brcmfmac AND blacklist brcmultil) disable the drivers for the RPi3's interal WiFi Adapter
This was done to enure use of an external WiFi antenna for connectivity reasons.
